For the Barkuspad 1_4. This is a pad I feel very proud of every time I make one, The first pad I ever made was good on accident and as a result the subsequent ones had flaws of their own I was unaware of.
The Barkuspad 1_4 Is good on purpose. It was made with the clear goal of being: Performant, Cost effective, and Reliable. Countless tests have been taken to ensure that these goals were met, you can see in the first images below
tests where an impulse was applied to a tile and reaction time was measured according to what type of contact was being used on the sensor. This is how the Barkuspad 1_4s' unique sensor contact shape came to be.

Anyway, all this is to say that this pad is capable of performing incredibly well, and with the help of the files within this folder it could last a lifetime.
