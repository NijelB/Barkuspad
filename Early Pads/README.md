These are all of the early pads that were designed and made, no more than 30 were ever made so they've been put in a seperate folder from the main folder. Due to the low amount of these pads that actually exist and large amount of files there aren't per file printing instructions, but as a baseline:
<br> 40% infill, 2 wall lines, 4 top layers, 4 bottom layers will work for all of the plastic parts here.
<br> 20% gyriod infill, 1 wall line, 4 top, 4 bottom layers will be a good starting point for the TPU parts.
