# Barkuspad
Welcome, here you will find parts and recources for all versions of the Barkus pad.

This also includes dance pad firmware for the NanoESP Development board, I hope someday this board, or another ESP32S3 based development board will become the go to for all dance pad controllers.
<br>The benifits are as follows:
><br>20 analog channels, allowing all kinds of different sensor configs up to 20 sensors.
<br><br>>USB-C.
<br><br>>240MHZ Dual core processor making it 30x as fast as a 16MHZ USB-C Arduino Micro clone if you use both cores. 1000HZ polling can easily be maintained with this proccesor even whith other heavy loads like a display and bluetooth. 
<br><br>>Native HID support, no need for workarounds like UnoJoy that require tampering with the bootloader.
<br><br>>Native bluetooth HID support, this could be really cool for travel pads. Imagine embedding this controller within a travel pad and powering it via a UL, CE, Etc... certified USB power bank, we could have cheap and easily made TSA friendly bluetooth travel pads.
<br><br>>Extremely flexible GPIO Pin mapping.
<br><br>>Low cost, a WaveShare dev board can be had for 8$ USD, furthermore the chip itself costs only 3$ USD.
<br>
The ESP32S3 is super promising, I hope to provide a good demonstration of its power to the dance pad community.

There are also folders for most of the 3d printed parts of the pad in here with details such that replacements parts can be had independant of me. Just open the folder for the version of pad you have and open the parts folder, then follow the instructions for said part.
