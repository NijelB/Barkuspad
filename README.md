# Barkuspad
Welcome, here you will find parts and resources for all versions of the Barkus pad. This also includes dance pad firmware for the NanoESP Development board, I hope someday this board, or another ESP32S3-based development board will become the go-to for all dance pad controllers.

# Benifits of ESP32:
### 20 Analog Channels
allowing all kinds of different sensor configs up to 20 sensors.
### USB-C
### 240MHZ Dual core processor
Making it 30x as fast as a 16MHZ USB-C Arduino Micro clone if you use both cores. 1000HZ polling can easily be maintained with this processor even with other heavy loads like a display and Bluetooth. 
### Native HID support
No need for workarounds like UnoJoy that require tampering with the bootloader.
### Native Bluetooth HID support
This could be really cool for travel pads. Imagine embedding this controller within a travel pad and powering it via a UL, CE, Etc... certified USB power bank, we could have cheap and easily made TSA-friendly Bluetooth travel pads.
### Extremely flexible GPIO Pin mapping
### Low cost
A WaveShare dev board can be had for 8$ USD, furthermore, the chip itself costs only 3$ USD.

The ESP32S3 is super promising, I hope to provide a good demonstration of its power to the dance pad community.

# Plastic Parts:
There are folders for most of the 3d printed parts of the pad in here with details such that replacement parts can be made independently. Just open the folder for the version of the pad you have and open the parts folder, then follow the instructions for said part.
