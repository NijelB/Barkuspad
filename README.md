# Barkuspad
Parts and recources for all versions of the barkus pad.

This also includes dance pad firmware for the NanoESP Development board, I hope someday this board, or another ESP32S3 based development board will become the go to for all dance pad controllers.
<br>The benifits are as follows:
><br><br>>20 analog channels, allowing all kinds of different sensor configs up to 20 sensors.
<br><br>>USB-C.
<br><br>>240MHZ Dual core processor making it 30x as fast as a 16MHZ USB-C Arduino Micro clone if you use both cores. 1000HZ polling can easily be maintained with this proccesor even whith other heavy loads like a display and bluetooth. 
<br><br>>Native HID support, no need for workarounds like UnoJoy that require tampering with the bootloader.
<br><br>>Native bluetooth HID support, this could be really cool for travel pads. Imagine embedding this controller within a travel pad and powering it via a UL, CE, Etc... certified USB power bank, we could have cheap and easily made TSA friendly bluetooth travel pads.
<br><br>>Extremely flexible GPIO Pin mapping.
<br><br>>Low cost, a WaveShare dev board can be had for 8$ USD, furthermore the chip itself costs only 3$ USD.

The ESP32S3 is super promising, I hope to provide a good demonstration of its power.
